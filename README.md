# School-Web
This is a school project where I had to build an entire web for my high school but this isn't the final version of the web
I am working in ths site to build lots of features but I pushed it in git to show my progress. Its not very hard to create a web but when 
you don't have a team ist much complicated cause you have to come up with a design which for me was the hardest part and still is, my bigest mistake was that I didn't create a design in the begining as a person who is new in this field I got this project cause I had the chance to implement the things I learned into this web.

This is build almost compleatly in React.js combined with css and I am trying to implement a logic part with javascript and probably work in building an api and a database to create a full  working version.
